# Seobot

We will create a .env file and run docker compose up --build. The application is designed to use the Gemini and Mistral APIs with a Supabase database and a Streamlit web frontend. It will use Playwright to research a website for SEO, generate a report, and provide a real-time score. An AI model will create automatic tasks for an article writer and a product description writer. A proof of concept has been tested on Render. The intent is to give small businesses a technological boost in SEO optimization and content creation with AI assistance.
